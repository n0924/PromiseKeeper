## Better transparency, better financial management 
#### *Personal Project: CPSC 210*
<br>

**PromiseKeeper simplifies the process of 
tracking expenses!**

### Managing budget is more important (and of course, harder) than setting a budget!


<p>For most people, staying on budget is essential for 
having a healthy life.
Not only does it stabilize our finance,
but also, it helps alleviate the stress we receive from
financial burdens. Most of us are aware of the importance 
of setting budgets; 
however, not everyone is capable of staying on budget. 
This application is for people, such as students, 
who want to optimize their limited funds by improving their 
money management. </p>

### Utilize Need/Want list to make wise choices

<p> This application aims to improve the transparency 
of how much and what the user spent the money. 
The Want or Need list feature helps them decide 
whether the purchase is necessary, 
which prevents impulsive buying. 
Furthermore, the Above-Budget feature reveals the items bought
at prices above budget, 
and how much they have overspent. 
Knowing their money usage is the 
first step in managing their finance well.</p>

### Aim of this project 
<p>As a student, it has always been a struggle to manage my finance. 
Staying on budget was challenging, as I was not fully aware of 
how I was spending my money. 
To keep track of my expenses, I started to check the transaction
record on my bank account everyday, 
which I found troublesome. 
Therefore, making financial management more accessible 
is the primary aim of this application.</p>
