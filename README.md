## Better transparency, better financial management 
#### *Personal Project: CPSC 210*
<br>

**PromiseKeeper simplifies the process of 
tracking expenses!**

### Managing budget is more important than setting a budget!


<p>For most people, staying on budget is essential for 
having a healthy life.
Not only does it stabilize our finance,
but also, it helps alleviate the stress we receive from
financial burdens. Most of us are aware of the importance 
of setting budgets; 
however, not everyone is capable of staying on budget. 
This application is for people
who want to optimize their funds by managing their finance well. </p>

### Utilize Need/Want list to make wise choices

<p> This application aims to improve the transparency 
of how much and how the user spent their money. 
The Want or Need list feature helps them decide 
whether the purchase is necessary, 
which prevents impulsive buying. 
Furthermore, the bought-want list feature helps the user know 
how they are spending money on wanted items. 
Although it is generally harder to cut budgets on needed items,
managing expenses on wanted goods can be achieved by better
decision making. Knowing their money usage is the 
first step in managing their finance well.</p>

### Aim of this project 
<p>As a student, it has always been a struggle to manage my finance. 
Staying on budget was challenging, as I was not fully aware of 
how I was spending my money. Making financial management 
more accessible is the primary aim of this application.</p>
